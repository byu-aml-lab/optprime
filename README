optprime: Optimize Prime
========================

This is the experimental optimization library of the AML Lab at Brigham
Young University.  As experimental code, many things are broken at any given
point in time.  The previous version of this library was called ``amlpso``
and this is a reorganized version (hence, "Optimize'").
